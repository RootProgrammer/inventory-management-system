# Inventory Management System Development Plan

## Project Overview

### Vision and Objectives
To develop a streamlined, efficient inventory management system specifically tailored for a beverage warehouse. The system will facilitate real-time inventory tracking, order management, expiry date monitoring, and demand forecasting to optimize stock levels, reduce waste, and improve operational efficiency.

### Stakeholders
- Warehouse Managers
- Inventory Clerks
- Development Team (Front-end, Back-end, QA)
- Suppliers

## System Requirements

### Key Features
- **Stock Tracking and Management**: Real-time monitoring of beverage stock levels, with detailed tracking of types, brands, sizes, and storage locations.
- **Batch and Expiry Date Management**: Tracking of batch numbers and expiry dates to ensure efficient stock rotation and minimize waste.
- **Order Processing**: Simplified management of purchase and sales orders, including returns, to maintain accurate stock levels.
- **Barcode Scanning**: Integration with barcode technology for efficient inventory handling and stocktakes.
- **Demand Forecasting**: Utilization of historical sales data to predict future demand and inform stock replenishment.
- **Supplier Management**: Management of supplier information and order history to streamline procurement processes.
- **Automated Reordering**: Automatic notifications or purchase orders triggered by low stock levels.
- **Reporting and Analytics**: Generation of reports on stock levels, sales performance, and order history for strategic planning.
- **Multi-Location Support**: Capability to manage inventory across multiple warehouse locations or storage areas.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Development of an intuitive and easy-to-navigate interface for all user interactions with the system.

### Technical Requirements
- **Front-end Development**: Utilize Flutter for developing a cross-platform application accessible via mobile and web.
- **Back-end Development**: Use Django for creating a robust, scalable back-end capable of handling inventory data management, API requests, and business logic.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for production due to its robustness and compatibility with Django; SQLite for development and testing.
- **Authentication**: Implement secure authentication mechanisms, potentially incorporating JWT for secure communication between front-end and back-end.

## Development Plan

### Agile Methodology
- Utilize Agile practices, breaking down the project into 2-week sprints.
- Employ Jira for sprint planning, task management, and progress tracking.
- Use Confluence for documenting project details, decisions, architecture, and user manuals.

### Design Phase
- **System Architecture**: Define the architecture, including the API structure between Flutter and Django.
- **Database Schema**: Design the schema focusing on inventory management needs.
- **UI/UX Design**: Develop mockups for the application, prioritizing usability and efficiency.

### Development Setup
- **Environment Setup**: Configure development environments for both Flutter and Django.
- **Project Initialization**: Set up the initial projects in Flutter for the front-end and Django for the back-end.

### Implementation and Testing
- **Sprint Execution**: Develop features according to priority, focusing on delivering functional increments each sprint.
- **Testing**: Implement unit, integration, and user acceptance testing to ensure reliability and usability.

### Deployment and Maintenance
- **CI/CD Setup**: Establish pipelines for continuous integration and deployment.
- **Deployment**: Choose a cloud provider and set up the production environment.
- **Maintenance**: Plan for ongoing support, bug fixes, and feature enhancements.

### Training and Documentation
- Provide comprehensive documentation for system users and maintainers.
- Conduct training sessions for end-users to ensure successful adoption.

## Additional Technologies and Tools
- **Django REST Framework** for API development.
- **Celery** for background task processing.
- **Docker** for containerization.
- **Nginx/Gunicorn** for serving the Django application.
- **Git** for version control.
- **GitHub Actions/GitLab CI** for CI/CD.
- **Swagger/Redoc** for API documentation.

## Conclusion

This document outlines a structured approach for developing an inventory management system tailored to the needs of a beverage warehouse. By leveraging Flutter and Django, and employing Agile methodologies, we aim to deliver a user-friendly, efficient, and scalable solution that meets the client's operational requirements and business objectives.
